-- Lab 6 â€“ SQL
-- March 3, 2016

-- Each problem is worth one point. No partial credit will be given. This lab is worth a total of 20 points.

-- Use hostname: classdb.jccc.edu

-- From this lab forward, please notice if a result table is in a particular order. If it is you must use the order by clause. Failure to do so will result in 0 points for that specific problem.

-- Place all answers into ONE .sql file. Attach that file to the Dropbox for Lab 6 in D2L. Only one .sql file will be accepted.

-- **** Use the AP table space for the following questions ****

-- 1.    Display the number of rows in the Invoice table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number of Invoices"
